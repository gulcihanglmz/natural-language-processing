# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Repository

Welcome to the **Natural Language Processing** repository! This project contains various NLP techniques, models, and applications designed to help you explore and understand the field of NLP.

## About the Project

This repository is dedicated to showcasing practical implementations of natural language processing techniques. The goal is to provide an educational and functional platform for anyone interested in NLP, whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer.

## Features

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, etc.)
- Sentiment analysis
- Text classification
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Language modeling
- Machine translation
- Topic modeling

## Technologies Used

The repository leverages the following technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing and basic NLP tasks.
- **spaCy**: For advanced NLP features like NER.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For state-of-the-art pre-trained models.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.

## Installation

To set up the environment and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/natural-language-processing.git
   cd natural-language-processing
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run any of the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to perform specific NLP tasks. For example:

```bash
python scripts/text_classification.py
```

Replace `text_classification.py` with the desired script name.
